<h2> How I made my website </h2>

<p> I've wanted to make a website for a long time, and after some learning
and practice, that is finally a reality :). In my very first blog post, I'll
go over the philosophy and ideas for this website, how I actually made it,
and how you can make your own. </p>

<h2> Philosophy </h2>

<p> First and foremost, I wanted this site to be minimal. I'm a fan of minimalism
in real life, and even more so when it comes to technology. As the ultimate challenge
(it's not actually that difficult), I decided to make my site with absolutely 0 JavaScript
and no external pings to other websites. I did this for a few reasons:
</p>

<ol>
    <li> No JS makes the site load faster and it means people who disable JS can have the same experience </li>
    <li> No external pings makes the site load faster </li>
    <li> I don't like programming in JS </li>
    <li> It's just a fun challenge </li>
</ol><p>
So, how did I actually accomplish this?
</p><p> 
Well, vanilla HTML and CSS are surprisingly powerful just on their own. The entire interface
can easily be made with plain old HTML and CSS, which makes the site faster, more secure and
easier to hack on than a massive site with the JavaScript framework. Now don't get me wrong;
JavaScript is a very useful language, but it's simply not necessary for a site like mine.</p>
<p> The only real technical challenge I encountered with this approach was syntax highlighting 
for code blocks. Most options out there are done with JS, which is probably the best way to do it
but I needed to stick to my challenge. You can always add an insane amount of &lt;span&gt; tags everywhere
and style them with CSS, but that's far from the best option... or is it? </p>
<p> Enter <a href="https://pygments.org/">pygments.</a> Pygments is a Python program for doing generic
syntax highlighting across several hundred different languages. The best part: you can export it to 
nicely formatted HTML for ease of use with CSS! For example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">with</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">nixpkgs</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="p">};</span>

<span class="n">mkShell</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">buildInputs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="n">python39Packages</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pygments</span>
        <span class="n">xclip</span>
    <span class="p">];</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p> If you turn off JavaScript in your browser, you can see you still get syntax highlighting. Isn't that awesome?</p>

<p> Now, to use Pygments efficiently I decided to write a quick mapping in Neovim for a simple task.
Here is the code snippet:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>map(&#39;n&#39;, &#39;&lt;C-s&gt;&#39;, &#39;:!xclip -sel c -o | pygmentize -f html | xclip -sel c &lt;CR&gt; &lt;CR&gt;&#39;, options)</pre></div>

<p> If you have a Lua configuration for Neovim, you can just drop that in. When you press Ctrl + S, it will 
read the code from your clipboard, highlight it and convert to HTML, and then put it back in your clipboard
so you can just paste it wherever you want.</p>

<h2> How I made the blog </h2>

<p> Well now that we have all that out of the way, how did I actually create the blog?
