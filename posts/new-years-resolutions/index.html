<h1> My New Year's resolutions </h1>

<p> So I've been on a self-improvement journey for a while now. As the new year comes soon, I want to set realistic, achievable goals
that will genuinely help me in life. I've set lots of goals before, and failed on some of them, and succeeded on others, so I really
want to be smart about it. So I'm setting up a plan now that I can follow. So my idea is to try 12 new habits in 2022: one each month. 
I also want to log the goals with my friends and family so they can keep me accountable and invite them to participate. Ideally I would
ramp up the difficulty of each one every time. Also I should keep in mind that I'm not meant to stick to every single one for the rest of my
life, just see what works and what doesn't. Hopefully writing this down here now gives me a point to come back to if I'm not motivated.
This idea isn't my own, I stole it from <a href="https://youtu.be/Um6f90guss4">Matt D'Avella. </a> Also stolen from him, I'll try the two 
day rule: you can skip some days for your habits, but never two or more days in a row.</p>

<p> I also want to write about my experiences and thoughts on this site, so hopefully you can take some away and help your own life. 
My idea is that, if I set each habit up so that it helps the next one, I'll be more successful. For example, if I want to read more and 
wake up earlier, I could read more one month at night, which in turn would help me sleep better, which in turn would help me sleep earlier.
So here are my current ideas for the 12 habits I'll try this coming year: </p>

<ul>
    <li> Drink more water; I own a 40 oz water bottle but usually I just drink around half of it each day. My goal is to drink all of it
    in one day, every day.</li>
    <li> Read a book per week: I have a backlog of books that I want to get to. Maybe do a short review of each book when I'm done? </li>
    <li> Meditation: meditate for at least 30 minutes each day. Log each meditation with friends, family, or by myself, and if I miss a day,
    make it up by doing double the next day. </li>
    <li> Excersize: set aside 20 minutes every morning for a short workout session. If I have the time, do longer or more intense sessions.
    Log them every day.</li>
    <li> Wake up 6 am or earlier: notoriously the hardest for me: hopefully the other habits help. Doing it in spring because usually I wake
    up earlier in spring.</li>
    <li> Journaling: I've journaled before but not much. Spend at least 15 minutes journaling, reflecting, and just writing down random 
    thoughts. </li>
    <li> Cold showers every morning: I like taking cold showers but I don't do it that often. Cold showers every morning wake me up and
    step me out of my comfort zone.</li>
    <li> Form a morning and night routine and stick to it, planned down to the minute.</li>
    <li> Track minutes/routine, every minute of every day.</li>
    <li> No sugar: cut out any and all excess sugar: the most sugary thing I would allow myself to eat would be an apple.</li>
    <li> Studying with spaced repetition: study daily and add new cards to the Anki app </li>
    <li> Compose/produce a piece/song every day that I am proud of. Can be just sheet music, or with full production.</li>

</ul>
