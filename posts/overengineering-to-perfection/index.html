<h1 id="Overengineering%20this%20site%20to%20perfection">Overengineering this site to perfection</h1>

<p>So I&#8217;ve written on here before how I made this site and the philosophy behind it, but recently I&#8217;ve made some changes that I want to detail here. I discovered the <a href="https://512kb.club">512kb.club</a>, which is a cool website listing a bunch of sites who&#8217;s homepage is under 512kb (mine included). When I found it, my homepage was around 10.5kb, and the site inspired me to minimize it to an even smaller size, which I did. This sent me down a long rabbit hole of minification, GitHub Actions, and optimizing every byte of code. </p>

<p>I started off completely rewriting my CSS, and got it down from about 4kb to less than 1. I used some trickery like splitting the highlight code, which was worth nearly 3kb on its own, into a seperate highlight.css file, since it&#8217;s not necessary for every single page. I also just removed a bunch of old stuff that wasn&#8217;t necessary anymore, which definetely helped. </p>

<p>Next off, I wanted to add some minification to make sure every file was as small as possible. However, this raised the issue of editing minified files; by definition, they are not made for humans to edit and read. So how did I solve this?</p>

<h2 id="Github%20Actions">Github Actions</h2>

<p>I was really surprised with how awesome GitHub Actions (and just DevOps in general) is. The Github free plan allowed me to spin up a server for free and automatically run repetitive tasks, like minification of my HTML and CSS. I also set up a <a href="https://github.com/notusknot/notusknot.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/commit.sh">simple script</a> to automatically update the commit at the bottom of the page with a link to the respective commit on GitHub. Completely useless, but I love it.</p>

<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>And yeah, that&#8217;s it pretty much. I don&#8217;t have much else to say other than the site is now better, and DevOps is cool.</p>
