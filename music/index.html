            <h1> Music </h1>
            <p> I think music is one of the greatest joys of life and everyone should try to incorporate it in theirs. I've been playing classical oboe 
                and rock/jazz drum set since early 2017, and began playing DCI-style marching percussion during the summer of 2021. I don't have much musical
                experience other than jamming with friends, practicing by myself, and playing in my school band, but from it, I've concluded that music
                is one of the most valuable things in my life. I've also toyed around with some music composition and music production in a DAW, and I've
                made a simple lo-fi hip-hop song with Bandcamp. I definetely want to look more into composition, production, and maybe even write some real songs :)
            </p>
            <p> I'm a big fan of jazz music, especially big band, fusion, and Latin styles as well as bossa nova. I also occasionally listen to rap/hip-hop, 
            indie and rock music. Some of my favorite artists/bands are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Maynard Ferguson (and his big band): </strong> great trumpet player and band director </li>
                <li> <strong>Arturo Sandoval: </strong> another fantastic trumpet player and band leader </li>
                <li> <strong>John Coltrane: </strong> super talented and famous tenor sax player </li>
                <li> <strong>Brad Meldhau Trio: </strong> awesome jazz trio </li>
                <li> <strong>Buddy Rich: </strong> one of the best and most famous jazz drummers of all time </li>
                <li> <strong>Bill Evans Trio: </strong> another great jazz trio </li>
                <li> <strong>Tommy Igoe Groove Conspiracy: </strong> awesome fusion jazz band </li>
                <li> <strong>Still Woozy: </strong> multi-talented indie musician that plays all the instruments in his songs </li>
                <li> <strong>Led Zeppelin: </strong> great rock band from 70s era </li>
                <li> <strong>Kendrick Lamar: </strong> great rapper </li>
                <li> <strong>Honorable mention:</strong> Jacob Collier: I don't listen to his music much but probably the most talented person I know of </li>
            </ul>
